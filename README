Cassandra Thrift Connection Pool
================================

This is an implementation of a Connection Pool for Cassandra's Thrift API based on Tomcat 7's excellent jdbc-pool

	http://people.apache.org/~fhanik/jdbc-pool/jdbc-pool.html
	
Because of this it supports the following features:

- settings for initialSize, maxIdle, minIdle and maxActive connections
- connection validation on borrow and return
- abandoned connection detection
- JMX MBean for easy monitoring

It also supports Cassandra Ring discovery with different failover policies
	
Most of the code was writtern by Filip Hanik, so the credit should go to him.

Maven artifacts should be available in Central
