Cassandra Connection Pool
=========================

This is an implementation of a Connection Pool for Cassandra based on Tomcat 7's excellent jdbc-pool

	http://people.apache.org/~fhanik/jdbc-pool/jdbc-pool.html
	
Because of this it supports the following features:

- settings for initialSize, maxIdle, minIdle and maxActive connections
- connection validation on borrow and return
- abandoned connection detection
- JMX MBean for easy monitoring
	
Most of the code was writtern by Filip Hanik, so the credit should go to him.

If you use Maven, you can get artifacts for this project at my repository:
